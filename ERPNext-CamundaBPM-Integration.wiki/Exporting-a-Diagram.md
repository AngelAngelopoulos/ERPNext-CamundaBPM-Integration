## Export BPMN diagram from Zeebe modeler as XML
In Zeebe modeler we can deploy our diagrams directly from the app, but only in two cases:
1. Using Camunda Cloud services.
2. Using self-hosting services.

In case that we need to export them, we can save file (.bpmn) and move them to another directory. The files .bpmn from Zeebe Modeler are XML files that represent all the diagram elements and information. We can use these files to deploy them without Zeebe Modeler.

## Export BPMN diagram from Zeebe modeler as images
Zeebe modeler has the option to export the diagram as images in formats ***jpg***, ***png***, and ***svg***.
